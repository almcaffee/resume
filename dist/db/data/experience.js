Although I had a bit of imposter syndrome on my day 1, by my second week I was already fixing bugs shipping production code. Prior to Amazon, i had mostly been working in code bases that used class based React components. I was able to dive a lot deeper into hooks and functional components using Typescript. I became a better engineer during my time at Amazon. Its those simple things like using maps vs arrays in state and being able to peer program and share my knowledge with some extremely smart albeit hard headed engineers, lol. Last but not least, before my time at Amazon i can honestly say i thought code commit was the worst but after using it the way its meant to be used and will the full suite of tools, I can say its pretty awesome with AWS tools.',
